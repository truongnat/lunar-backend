to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the deployment documentation for more information.\nIf you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out Mau, our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:\nExample :$ pnpm install -g @nestjs/mau\n$ mau deployWith Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.\nResources\nCheck out a few resources that may come in handy when working with NestJS:\n\nVisit the NestJS Documentation to learn more about the framework.\nFor questions and support, please visit our Discord channel.\nTo dive deeper and get more hands-on experience, check out our official video courses.\nDeploy your application to AWS with the help of NestJS Mau in just a few clicks.\nVisualize your application graph and interact with the NestJS application in real-time using NestJS Devtools.\nNeed help with your project (part-time to full-time)? Check out our official enterprise support.\nTo stay in the loop and get updates, follow us on X and LinkedIn.\nLooking for a job, or have a job to offer? Check out our official Jobs board.\n\nSupport\nNest is an MIT-licensed open source project. It can grow thanks to the sponsors and support by the amazing backers.
